They don designer grunge, play Street Fighter games, obey
their own subculture rules, huddle in the Dunkin' Donuts or Pronto coffee bars,
and make factions and fashion in a catwalk dream of lawless cool and subzero
fun. They are Japan's "Generation X," the lost youth. They are the Shibucaji
(Shibuya casual). They are the product of nearly 50 years of peace. Kazuma
Suzuki , a globe-trotting fashion model and aspiring actor, describes his generation
as _"heiwa -boke,"_ or literally
people spaced out on peace.

Lost and casual though they may be, their futures are
engineered and cloned like laboratory mice. But most will never wear blue suits
like their burnt-out fathers. Salarymen are dead. Uniformity is Dead. Long Live
Typecasting.

Some will go on to join large corporations and others
will stray away into riskier paths. Whichever way they go, their destinies are
set early in their school years. There, in addition to gaining marketable
skills, they are labeled and encouraged to live a life stereotypes. A typical 

conversation among high school kids ends with an
unwittingly Kafkaesque remark. "Oh, so you're that type."

Even a nouveaux hippie -- essentially a brand-free
generic description -- is a clear-cut type in Japan. Olive or Popeye retro-vogue
standards dictate your right to call yourself a hippie -- not your free spirit.
Typecasting goes so far that some employers (more than you think) rely on blood
types and astrological signs as criteria for hiring in the post-industrial
economy.

Yet, in this electronic prison of stereotypes, there
is an underground of rebels, individualists who refuse to identify. Kazuma
Suzuki, a high school dropout, is one. For Jun Imai, jobs are like pancakes -
to be flipped frequently. Kinugawa Yuri is living on a shoestring budget and
caviar dreams. Nikaido Satoshi is a waiter and he is not a waiter.

All were lost, much like their Shibucaji peers, until
they found the Method.

system of acting
techniques created by the legendary 19th-century Russian thespian, Constantin Stanislavski,
the Method has become an institution for stage and screen actors in America. Robert De Niro,
Marlon Brando, James Dean, Paul Newman and Marilyn Monroe are just some of its
success stories. 

Before the Method's advent, writes theater historian Oscar
G. Brockett, the mark of a good actor was impersonation. With the Method,
psychological preparation became an important element, along with vocal and physical
attributes, in an actor's training. 

Rather than mimicking or relying on a preconceived notion
of what a character should be, actors reared in the Method venture to produce
fully rounded, believable,

living characters on stage. An entity separate from the
actor. A spirit in its own right. To accomplish such a creation, actors entered
the same world noh actors, Zen priests, yogis, gurus and psychiatrists like
Carl Hung have explored: the subconscious.

The Tsutsujigaoka training space of the United Performers
Studio is significantly different from dance studios -- there are no mirrors.

Around six on a gray Wednesday evening, about 20
people, ranging from 16 to 40 years in age, shuffled into the spare
white-walled basement studio. Yoko Narahashi, producer, lyricist and Method
instructor extraordinaire, switched on some New Age music to begin the session.

The students began to walk around in circles,
experimenting with a variety of gaits that put Monty Python's Ministry of Silly
Walks to shame. Then they seated themselves and moaned away for a time-warping 30
minutes in real time. To the uninitiated, it could seem like the Twilight Zone.

The bizarre rigors had a purpose. The relaxation
exercises are designed to free the mind from inhibitions.

"I didn't know what relaxation meant until I signed
up at UPS," says Kinugawa rather hesitantly.

As the youths moaned away in their seats, eyes
closed, some burst into tears, while others erupted into uncontrollable
laughter. For others, the mood was contagious, as laughter or moans enveloped
them. All the while Narahashi and a few of her assistants circled around the
inner voyagers, making sure that they were well on their way to releasing
ego-valves to release the source of inspiration.

Some were unable to take it, tensing up and refusing to
complete their exercises.

"One of my students was scared, and she failed
to show up for a long time," explains Narahashi. lt's not hard to see why.
With genuinely miserable moans and whining, some kids seemed to relive their
past traumas. Others seemed to fear discovering their inner core. Within 30
minutes, after the torrent of their moaning meditation, all of their hang-ups
for the day seemed washed away. The participants looked ready to act.

In a repetition exercise carried out in pairs, the
actors were nothing but confrontational.

"You are scared." Kinugawa accused her
partner who was busy ignoring her.

"'Scared?"

"Yes, scared."

"You're scheming!"

"OK, I'm scheming."

The catch-ball continued on the brink of violence. Some
improvised dialogue led to sarcastic outbursts, others wandered into sexual
innuendo. One pair entered into a well-rounded husband-and-wife relationship, with
all the intricacies of marriage condensed into five quality minutes. Without
lines, and without a director's input, the actors drew their own script from
the surrounding environment - some makeshift props and each other. And from
such a base, there was nothing else for them to do but to confront the moment,
or else Narahashi, with her watchful eye of experience, would know.

Some students used what Narahashi called,
"society words," such as "That's alright," or "Thank
you." In the repetition exercise, these banalities are taboo because the
aim, after all, is to say what you feel at the moment. For many of the
students, the experience is an eye-opener.

"After discovering the Method, I 've been able
to accept many things," says Nikaido gently.

Kinugawa concurs: " l 've been able to
understand my inner barriers and, instead of running away, I face them. "
A head-on collision was demonstrated in the

repetition exercise, when an emotional bruise was bared
for all to see as she vented her grief through real tears.

he power of the Method, in addition to showing a way to
self-discovery, has helped bridge cultural divides. At least that 's what
Narahashi experienced when she directed award-winning Imai Masayuki's _Winds Of God_, a production that went on
to win

numerous international awards and made waves in New York
at The Actor's Studio, the Grand Central Station of Method acting.

Barring comments that their English were not native (one
wonders how many American actors could perform an entire play in Japanese),
most reviews commended the quality of acting. The story is about two aspiring
comedians who magically find themselves reenacting

their past lives as kamikaze pilots.

"At the Actor's Studio, we received standing
ovations," says Narahashi with pride in knowing that the member-actors and
the New York crowd are critically rough, even if supportive. Undoubtedly, the
most touched in the audience were the American World War

II veterans who had lived through the kamikaze attacks. For
them, the play did its magic by healing some old wounds.

"They were the people with the binocular
vision," recalls Narahashi. ''One vet came up to us and said, "For many
years, I hated you guys.' "

The cross-cultural feat seems all the more amazing when
taking into consideration that none of the actors were well-versed in English.
Unlike younger talents who might have gone through the Model Language Studio
program, the actors went through three months of phonetic line memorization.
Still, they pulled off a moving revelation, in all its complexities, of what
essentially was the Japanese side of the tragedy.

For the actors themselves, the experience was a
discovery about their own language. When they set out to perform the play in
Japanese, it wasn't as easy as they thought it would be. The Method actors, having
become accustomed to breathing life into words and not the other way around,
found that Japanese is more structured than English. Hierarchical relationships
are more crystalline, pre-casting the characters before the actors could do it
on their own.

"They were all laughing," commented
Narahashi, about their first attempt to re-cross the cultural divide as they
prepared for the Tokyo performance.

obody was laughing June 12 at the Kitazawa Town Hall in
hip Shimokitazawa. There, Kinugawa, donning a red frock, could be seen roaming about
the lobby. The cast members were going over their lines, while ot hers smoked
cigarettes with a faraway look. On this gray, overcast clay, their skills as Method
actors were about to be tested.
